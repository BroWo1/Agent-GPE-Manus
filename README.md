# Web OpenManus ðŸ™‹

A basic WebUI for OpenManus made using Gradio, visualizing the process of chatting with the UI agent.  
Visit https://github.com/mannaandpoem/OpenManus for the opensource OpenManus repository.

Made by a Chinese high school student, so the function of this UI is still very simple now. Continuing updating with the OpenManus project.
